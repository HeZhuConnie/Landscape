1. Landscape
(1). Landscape is generated by applying Diamond-square algorithm. We first create a terrain in Unity. Then in the scripts we set the height of each vertex of that terrain (using method terrainData.SetHeights())using the heightmap calculated by Diamond-square-algorithm. 

(2). In Unity, to generate a new landscape, you need to go to the “LandscapeCreator” under “Landscape” object. Then click “Create Terrain” button under “Create Landscape” script.
The newly generated landscape need to be rendered again. To render a landscape, you should go to “Landscape” object, and click “Render Terrain” button under “Render Landscape” script.

2. Camera Motion
(1). Camera is loaded in a capsule object and has relational position zero. Then the camera with its capsule will detect collisions to prevent go through the terrain or go beyond boundary. Camera will follow the WASD motion rules as well as mouse direction control. Mouse sensibility can be adjusted by changing ‘Mouse sens’ in Unity.

(2). Four box colliders have been constructed in each broader of the ‘world’.So the camera will not go outside or see underground.

(3). Camera fixes its x and z position when first loading the project. To avoid the camera starts under the terrain, the initial y position is set at a constant hight (initial height attribute in CameraContainer in Unity) above the terrain at that point.

3. Surface 
(1). Sun is texture rendered and rotate around the heart of the terrain, monitoring the real sun rising and sunsetting. At night time, the moon will rise with a lower intensity to prevent the entire black view. ‘Speed’ attribute in Sun and Moon objects links to the length of day/night time.

(2). Phong illumination model is being used to simulate sun reflection of water surface.
